# Changelog

## v0.1.0 Candidate - 2026-05-13

POKit v0.1.0 is the Day 2/3 dogfood release candidate.

### Included

- GitHub-distributed repo-native AI workspace for PO/PM work.
- LLM-first quickstart for Codex and Claude natural-language use.
- POKit Brief / next-cycle nudge dashboard.
- Goal-loop guidance for Claude Code `/goal` and Codex skill-based operation.
- Linear read helpers for teams, working cycle context, cycle issues, and labels.
- Optional Linear team selection with automatic single-team detection and `LINEAR_TEAM_KEY` support.
- Dry-run first Linear write helpers with idempotency keys and explicit approval guards.
- Sprint runner that routes `pokit:prd` and `pokit:criteria` issues.
- Run Summary with `AI가 하지 않은 것` first.
- Local PRD and acceptance criteria draft generation with `content_hash` frontmatter.
- Completed/canceled Linear issue skipping.
- Working-context selection that skips completed upcoming cycles when a later cycle has open Todo work.
- Completed-cycle immutability guard: new Todo work moves to the next cycle unless the user explicitly reopens the completed cycle.
- Cycle-first completion reports and compact resume brief generation.
- Cycle-level next-action wording so users are not asked to approve mechanical substeps.
- Brief output now shows one Cycle-level execution sentence and no numbered quick-command prompts.
- Release/Hotfix Cycle policy and guard metadata for deployment omissions and urgent redeploys.
- Hotfix Cycle creation helper and EVM-44 move dry-run for deployment omission tracking.
- Cycle maintenance helper for Linear cycle completion dry-runs when POKit operational completion drifts from Linear date state.
- Label preflight dry-run helper.
- Cycle retro draft helper.
- Onboarding checklist, README quickstart, first-run smoke test, skill guidance, and example Linear issues.
- Security guidance for `.env`, API key rotation, and generated artifacts.
- Public repo artifact policy: dogfood examples live under `examples/`, local generated outputs stay under `artifacts/`.
