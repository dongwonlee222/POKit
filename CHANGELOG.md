## v0.1.1 Hotfix - 2026-05-13

This hotfix removes private dogfood Linear state from the public template and adds a release safety gate.

### Fixed

- Replaced live `memory/resume-brief.md` state with a public-safe starter placeholder.
- Sanitized dogfood examples so public samples no longer contain private Linear workspace URLs or cycle IDs.
- Removed private Linear cycle IDs and concrete dogfood defaults from script examples.
- Changed Hotfix and Cycle maintenance helpers so public CLI defaults no longer embed a private workspace's cycle data.
- Added `scripts/public-safety-scan.ts` and test coverage to block private Linear workspace slugs, private cycle IDs, and live tracked memory state before public release.
- Documented the public release safety scan in README, AGENTS, script docs, and the operating model.

### Verification

- Public safety scan passed.
- Test suite passed: 67/67.

### Included

- GitHub-distributed repo-native AI workspace for PO/PM work.
- LLM-first quickstart for Codex and Claude natural-language use.
- POKit Brief / next-cycle nudge dashboard.

- Local PRD and acceptance criteria draft generation with `content_hash` frontmatter.
- Completed/canceled Linear issue skipping.
- Working-context selection that skips completed upcoming cycles when a later cycle has open Todo work.
- Completed-cycle immutability guard: new Todo work moves to the next cycle unless the user explicitly reopens the completed cycle.
- Cycle-first completion reports and compact resume brief generation.
- Cycle-level next-action wording so users are not asked to approve mechanical substeps.
- Brief output now shows one Cycle-level execution sentence and no numbered quick-command prompts.

- Hotfix Cycle creation helper and issue move dry-run for deployment omission tracking.
- Cycle maintenance helper for Linear cycle completion dry-runs when POKit operational completion drifts from Linear date state.

- Cycle retro draft helper.
- Onboarding checklist, README quickstart, first-run smoke test, skill guidance, and example Linear issues.

### Out Of Scope

- A/B test implementation.
- Persona test implementation.
- PDF export.
- Automatic cron.
- Standalone CLI product or global installer.
- Silent Linear/GitHub writes.
- Automatic GitHub push, tag, or release publication.

### Release Gate

- Clean check recorded in `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.

- GitHub tag/release publication is tracked by the repository tag and GitHub release record.
- Tag/release creation requires explicit user approval before the public write.
